Welcome to the JetBrains Quest.

What awaits ahead is a series of challenges. Each one will require a little initiative, a little thinking, 
and a whole lot of JetBrains to get to the end. Cheating is allowed and in some places encouraged. 
You have until the 15th of March at 12:00 CET to finish all the quests.
Getting to the end of each quest will earn you a reward.
Let the quest commence!
