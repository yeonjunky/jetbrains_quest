Welcome to the JetBrains Quest.

What awaits ahead is a series of challenges. Each one will require a little initiative, a little thinking, 
and a whole lot of JetBrains to get to the end. Cheating is allowed and in some places encouraged. 
You have until the 15th of March at 12:00 CET to finish all the quests.
Getting to the end of each quest will earn you a reward.
Let the quest commence!

'''JetBrains has a lot of products, but there is one that looks like a joke on our Products page, you should start there... '''
(hint: use Chrome Incognito mode)
It’s dangerous to go alone take this key: Good luck! == Jrrg#oxfn$

To get these digits you need to know how many prime numbers there are between 500 and 5000


Good Luck!
